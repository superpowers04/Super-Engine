# Super Engine (Unstable) [![Build](https://github.com/superpowers04/FunkinBattleRoyale-Mod/actions/workflows/main.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/superpowers04/FunkinBattleRoyale-Mod/actions/workflows/main.yml)
A custom engine based on [Funkin Battle Royale](https://github.com/XieneDev/FunkinBattleRoyale/) and very loosely based on [Kade Engine](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine) to add a whole bunch of features such as
- No base game bloat
- No hardcoding(Except for BF, GF and the default stage to provide fallbacks)
- Scriptable songs, states, stages and characters using HScript that allows you extensive control over the game allowing for new mechanics, custom features, overhauls and more(Eventually I'll add lua support. it's technically implemented but extremely broken)
- Customizability for most of the features in the engine to make the engine how you want it
- Basic support for Psych Engine, VSlice, and base game mod folders(In some cases you can just symlink or drag and drop a folder for a mod into your `mods/packs` folder and all of the charts will just appear)
- Error handling that'll never have you restart the game because a chart was missing(why is this an issue in other engines :sob:)
- Drag and drop charts into the game's window to play them
- Multikey support

All without recompiling the game at all or editing source code.
<br>I highly recommend against editing source code if it can be done with a script. If you do have any source code improvements you want to make, you should PR them or push them to a fork.

This is powered by a modded version of [Kade Engine](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine) with a hint of [FPSPlus](https://github.com/ThatRozebudDude/FPS-Plus-Public/) added in and with some inspiration from [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)/[FNF Multi](https://shadowmario.itch.io/funkinmulti) <br>
I do not own Friday Night Funkin, Kade Engine or Funkin Battle Royale, I'd highly recommend checking them out.

# Modding information
Read the [mods/readme.txt](https://github.com/superpowers04/Super-Engine/blob/nightly/example_mods/readme.txt) for info about installing/making custom characters, charts, stages and more. 
<br>**Anything beyond bf and gf SHOULD NOT be hardcoded into this engine.** This engine is meant to be a 1 time install with updates, Please do not package this engine inside of a mod. 
<br>If you *have* to include an engine/exe in your mod, [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine), [Codename Engine](https://github.com/CodenameCrew/CodenameEngine),  are far more fit for this. 

## Compiling
- Follow the guide on the Funkin github page [here](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin#build-instructions), this should be completely compatible with that guide. 
  Although you will also need to use the installDeps.bat file. While it is a bat file, it works on Windows, Mac and Linux. I only named it .bat so it can work properly on Windows machines or whatever
  **Do note this file installs dependancies globally.** Super Engine specifically tells Lime/Haxe what versions of libraries to use or tries to aim for support with the latest libraries so no global settings should need to be changed
