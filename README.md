# Super Engine
This is a mod of [Funkin Battle Royale](https://github.com/XieneDev/FunkinBattleRoyale/)<br>
This is powered by a modded version of [Kade Engine](https://github.com/KadeDev/Kade-Engine) with a hint of [FPSPlus](https://github.com/ThatRozebudDude/FPS-Plus-Public/) added in and with some inspiration from [Psych Engine](https://github.com/ShadowMario/FNF-PsychEngine)/[FNF Multi](https://shadowmario.itch.io/funkinmulti) <br>
I do not own Friday Night Funkin, Kade Engine or Funkin Battle Royale, I'd highly recommend checking them out.
This client aims to allow people to use normal Funkin Battle Royale servers with custom characters or play custom charts and such when offline<br>

## Compiling
- Follow the guide on the Funkin github page [here](https://github.com/ninjamuffin99/Funkin#build-instructions), this should be completely compatible with that guide

# Read mods/readme.txt for info about custom characters, charts, stages and more. Custom characters and charts beyond vanilla charts, bf and gf SHOULD NOT be hardcoded into this engine
